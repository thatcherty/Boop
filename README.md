# Overview
This was the branch used to create the initial idea behind the trie. The concept and structure were used in the original implementation.

We also attempted to integrate the trie into a full gameplay, but found that the Black player was getting trios constantly, but the Orange player was not. More debugging is needed to implement the trie as is. Alternatively, we could sample complete games rather than just the first three-in-a-row to potentially improve this.
